## Cell Shading a 3D object with Mosaic Effect
In this project I used C++, OpenGl, GLSL and SDL to build and render a 3D teapot with a Mosaic effect. Cell shading is a type of non-photorealistic rendering that is used to give objects a cartoonish appearance. The mosaic effect gave the 3D object additional features by applying a patterned effect. I implemented shading, normals, textures and developed an OBJ Wavefront parser.
